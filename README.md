**WWWWW** stands for Who, What, When, Where, and Why. It's a simple bash script to add whatami, whenami, whereami, whyami aliases alongside the built-in whoami command.

The only purpose for writing this to specifically promote the whyami alias which will open up the Holy Bible. Praise the Lord.

```bash
$ whoami # built-in
	$USER
$ whatami
	$0
$ whenami
	${date}
$ whereami
	${your state}
$ whyami # praise the lord
	${Holy Bible | less}
```

## Executing

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notwithering/wwwww/main/wwwww.sh | sh
```
