# Code of Conduct

## 1. Reason

To be honest, the main reason for this repo is just to spread the word of god. The code in this repo took me about a minute to write.

## 1.1 Scope

This conduct only applies to people that wish to follow the conduct. Faith is a choice that will change your life for the better. Unfortunately, many still decide to deny faith.
